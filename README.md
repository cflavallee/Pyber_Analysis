# Pyber Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to examine PyBer data from a specific time frame as it relates to city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  Various categories were highlighted and a line graph of weekly fares by city type was created.  This analysis of PyBer data in this way can assist the company in its decision making process for operations in these three city types. 

## Results
Below are the results from creating DataFrames based on speciic metrics. As one might expect, Urban areas had higher total numbers, however, Rural areas had the highest fare per ride average, as well as average fare per driver.
